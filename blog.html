              The question of how actually does the Instagram algorithm  work concerns everyone who is 
              interested in promoting an Instagram account. A few years ago, a social network had a simple 
              and understandable chronological feed – posts in this feed were showing up depending on the 
              time of posting. Now the feed is developed individually for each user, and it is the algorithm 
              that decides whether your content will be seen or lost at the very bottom of the feed.

            <p class="modal__right-descr">
              Setting up ads through Facebook offers the user more opportunities and different options, while 
              in the application you can only specify the gender, age, place of residence and interests of the 
              target audience.
              For some specialists, this will be quite enough to promote their services. However, only the 
              Facebook advertising account has the fine-tuning tools, and they will help those who want to 
              reduce the spendings on the advertising and customize ads for more specific groups of people.<br>
              
              <b>1. Choosing a specific goal.</b><br>
              Unlike the Instagram application, Facebook account allows you to configure advertising in such 
              a way as to get specific actions from a potential subscriber – whether it's a like, checking out 
              a profile or getting a direct message. To do this, you just need to specify the goal at the very 
              beginning of creating an advertising campaign.<br>
              More complex commercial structures can also use more specific goals – for example, 
              the goal of "Brand awareness" allows you to increase the reach of an advertisement among those 
              who are interested in similar products, and the goal of "Branch attendance" helps attract 
              customers to offline stores.<br>
              
              <b>2. Fine-tuning geography.</b><br>
              In the Facebook advertising account, you can specify not only the location, but also the exact 
              radius of users reach.<br>
              At the same time, the categories of users may differ – you will be able to show your ad to 
              both locals and travelers. The latter will be especially useful for residents of resort areas.<br>
              
              <b>3. Expanded choice of interests.</b><br>
              Facebook audience settings section has a certain similarity to what can be found in the 
              Instagram application, but Facebook's advertising account offers the user the opportunity to 
              customize the interests of the audience in detail, specify the position, level of education, 
              and behavior on the Internet.<br>
              If you have specified one interest, the system can independently suggest additional parameters 
              that may be useful to you. You can specify them in the "Narrow the audience" subsection.<br>
              If you want to exclude a particular segment from the audience, you can specify other 
              characteristics in the "Exclude people" subsection.<br>
              
              <b>4. Setting up the placement.</b><br>
              Instagram Facebook Facebook Instagram feed, Instagram stories, etc. When setting up ads on 
              Facebook, you can specify particular locations or combinations of them as a place to post. If 
              desired, you can configure the display of ads only for mobile device users – you can even choose 
              the type of operating system: Android or IOS.<br>
              This is not the only way how you can limit the display of your ads. You can set the exact 
              schedule like days and hours your ad should be displayed – this will help you save your 
              advertising budget.<br>

          <h4 class="modal__right-title">What a corporate identity / logo is required for?</h4>
          <p class="modal__right-descr">
            Emotions play an important role while implementing any branding strategy. Companies use emotions to get the audience to complete the targeted action (purchase) and it is not a secret.<br>

            An effective branding strategy enhances an organization's reputation and gives it a unique identity in a competitive marketplace. Identity (corporate identity) is an important element of business success both in the short-term and long-term perspective.<br>

            Developing a strong corporate identity is an extremely important success factor for any business. Effective branding will assist to build a reputation, stand out from the competitors and attract new customers.<br>

            Corporate identity is more than just a logo. With the help of a corporate identity, a business shows its individuality and creates an idea for customers about what the business really is. Corporate identity should reflect the qualities that the brand represents, as well as build trust from both customers and partners.<br>

            Identity allows the audience to distinguish you from your competitors. It has a positive effect on customer decisions, directly affecting your profitability. Despite this, there are several myths and misconceptions that, according to small business owners, hinder the development of corporate identity.<br>


            Myth #1 – We can create our own brand on our own<br>

            We are all familiar with do-it-yourself brands. What is your impression of a self-printed, black and white business card? Obviously not the best. Or, what do you think of a website that is made “in home style”? People judge the ability and quality of a business based on first impressions, both on the Internet and beyond. Don't lose potential customers because of an unprofessionally developed corporate identity.<br>

            Myth #2 - We can't afford to develop a professional corporate identity.<br>


            A professionally designed corporate identity costs money, but investments in this trend can pay off several times over. Lack of a high-quality visual identity can cost your business much more. Creating a logo that doesn't align with your vision, values, target audience, and positioning can lead to the confusion in the market. For example, if you provide quality services with attention to detail, lack of attention to detail in corporate identity will send a conflicting message to customers. That is why it is worth contacting experienced professionals to create a high-quality identity.<br>



            Myth #3 - We don't need a brand (corporate identity)<br>

            As more people search for products and services online, every business needs a high-quality visual identification. How do you imagine your business on the Internet without a corporate identity? A brand is not just a corporate identity and logo. A brand is what customers think of you, it's how well you provide your services. A brand is always an advantage.<br>

            Components of corporate identity<br>

            If analyzed more globally, corporate identity consists of three parts:<br>

            ● Corporate design (logos, flyers, brochures, business cards and stationery)<br>
            ● Corporate communication (advertising, public relations)<br>
            ● Corporate behavior (internal values, ethics and norms)<br>

            A business that invests in creating an identity automatically declares that it is going to become a major “player” in its niche.<br>

            Creating a corporate identity is an important part of any branding strategy. The detail study is necessary to develop a style that will meet the objectives of the business and send the right message to customers. You need to clearly know what qualities of your business are the most important and what does your target audience want. This will help create an attractive identity.<br>

            Key elements of corporate identity:<br>

            ● logo<br>
            ● corporate colors<br>
            ● fonts<br>
            ● corporate identity attributes<br>
            ● images style.<br>





            Why is corporate identity important for the success of any business?<br>

            1. Personality. A brand identity is a visual representation of the values and characteristics of a business. Corporate identity, in fact, "sets the style" of your business. With its help, you can evoke certain feelings in the audience, thereby tending it to targeted actions. The main task of corporate identity is to convey the vocation of your brand and its objectives to the audience.<br>

            2. Integrity. Corporate identity development allows you to create the same corporate look for all marketing materials. Every item that is relevant to your business will have the same basic styles and design elements, creating a cohesive brand experience.<br>

            3. Differentiation. Corporate identity allows you to distinguish your business from competitors, as well as position yourself correctly. Developing a professional, creative design will help divert the attention of potential customers and partners from your competitors.<br>

            4. Loyalty. An effective corporate identity will help strengthen customer loyalty and trust in the brand. It will create a bond between the product and the company.<br>


            Why is a logo as important as branding?<br>

            1. An attractive logo is an effective marketing and promotion tool. Consumers will always remember the service or product, the design of which appeals to them.<br>

            2. Service quality is always accompanied by a good name: don't forget, a positive reputation is the result of a joint work of the logo and customer service.<br>

            3. Identity gives the client confidence in the business (product), confidence in the quality and a positive opinion about the services provided: a good corporate identity clamps down any negative thought.<br>

            4. The logo boosters the expansion of business opportunities: the corporate image is like a magnet. It attracts the attention of not only customers, but also interested investors and business partners.<br>

            5. A logo helps a business stand the test of time – in a highly competitive marketplace, consumers are always looking for alternatives. The right logo will remain relevant and effective over 15, 25, 60+ years.<br>



            9 tips for creating and developing a strong brand<br>

            ● Start by defining your brand. Analyze the product or service your business offers. Determine the place in the market, study the emotional and rational needs of your customers. Your brand should promote your business, attract new customers, and set you apart from your competitors.<br>

            ● When creating a brand, think of it as a human. Each of us is a human whose character is made up of beliefs, values and goals that determine who we are and with whom we interact, how we behave in different situations, how we dress and what we say. Of course, for humans, this is intuitive, and rarely anyone thinks about it. When you're creating a brand, it's important to have an idea of the nature of your brand.<br>
            ● Create a corporate identity that is specific to your business and matches the vision of your organization. Analyze the desires of the target audience and use them during the development of the logo and other corporate identity elements. Determine what it believes in, what its goal is, and who its heroes are. These points will help you understand the emotional positioning of the brand.<br>
            ● Create your brand story. Come up with a sensitive but realistic story about how your business was created. Emotions are the key to taking a targeted action. Give an emotion to the customer, and he will take the target action.<br>
            ● Monitor your online reputation. Ask happy customers to leave their reviews on review sites like Google Maps. Such feedbacks will increase the credibility of your organization.<br>
            ● Strive to build long-term relationships with customers. Don't raise customer expectations, build trust with honest branding - be clear about what your company is and what values it is driven by.<br>
            ● Improve customer service. Treat customers the way you would want to be treated if you were a customer.<br>
            ● Be creative - stand up for what you believe in. Large brands are burdened with a big number of bureaucrats that do not allow them to be flexible and respond to constantly changing customer requirements. Flexibility is what makes you more attractive than big brands.<br>
            ● Communicate in social networks and increase your brand awareness.<br>

            Building relationships with the audience is the most important task in creating a brand. Communicate, interact, exchange experience. Communication is the best way to build public relations.<br>

            Conclusion<br>

            Remember, if you have a business, you have a brand. What you do with it is up to you. If your brand matches your vision and focuses on the requirements of your target audience, this is the first sign of moving in the right direction.<br>
            An established corporate identity improves the competitiveness of an organization by increasing awareness among the customers and the general public.<br>

            The identity also increases the level of motivation of the employees of the organization, and this increases the efficiency of the organization as a whole. Employees are always proud to work in an organization with a strong corporate identity.<br>

            A corporate identity supported by quality services not only attracts the attention of customers, but also helps to attract potential investors and builds trust among various partners and investors.<br>

          <h4 class="modal__right-title">Instagram algorithms 2022 - for posts and stories</h4>
          <p class="modal__right-descr">
            The question of how actually does the Instagram algorithm  work concerns everyone who is 
            interested in promoting an Instagram account. A few years ago, a social network had a simple and 
            understandable chronological feed – posts in this feed were showing up depending on the time of 
            posting. Now the feed is developed individually for each user, and it is the algorithm that 
            decides whether your content will be seen or lost at the very bottom of the feed.<br>

            There are many myths and tales about the algorithm. For example, many people believe that the 
            number of likes that a post gets affects getting the recommendations. However, Instagram denied 
            this information.<br>
            
            <b>1. 4 main factors affecting the ranking of posts in the feed.</b><br>
            Instagram itself calls the algorithm "a personalization of the user experience". Instagram 
            algorithms evaluate many "signals" that ultimately affect whether a user will see a particular 
            post in the feed among the first ones or not. No one knows all the "signals" except for the 
            developers, but Instagram mentioned the 4 most important factors that affect the ranking of posts 
            in the feed:<br>
            Publication information. The impressions are important for the algorithm. If people actively put 
            likes, comment on the post and share it, this increases its chance to rise to the very top of the 
            feed.<br>
            Information on the user who posted a publication. How long have you been following this account? 
            Do you visit it often? Do you go to Direct for communication? How many people have interacted with 
            this user recently? Algorithms consider this information trying to show those with whom you have 
            interacted in recent weeks more often.<br>


            Information on your activity. Instagram algorithms evaluate to what extent the content topics can 
            get you interested. Choosing between a photo with text or pictures of architecture, 
            they evaluate, which of the posts you liked, saved, reposted or commented on more often. 
            They remember whether you like posts with or without long captions, videos, or photos. 
            Every action you take with the content matters for creating the feed.<br>
            Information on your interaction history with the user who posted the publication. If you often 
            chat with a user in Direct, comment on each other's posts, reply to stories - the algorithm will 
            consider that you want to see his/her content in the feed more often.<br>

            The feed of each user is unique and is formed depending on his/her interests and interaction with 
            the content. On one hand, this leds to a drop in reach. Often even close people do not see each 
            other's posts in the feed. On the other hand, the algorithms try to show everyone those 
            publications that may be of interest to him/her. It is your user actions that create the posts 
            feed and the "explore" tab.<br>

            <b>2. Instagram hides content with watermarks and other app logos.</b><br>
            This point is especially relevant for those who study Instagram algorithms for a bigger reach.
            Instagram supports a high-quality and original content.<br>
            Algorithms try not to offer content with:<br>
            ● Watermarks;<br>
            ● Logos of other applications.<br>
            By adding photos/videos from another platform, for example TikTok, you will be losing the reach. 
            If you make the same post on different platforms, keep the source files, or crop the logos.<br>


            <b>3. Profile verification does not provide any advantages over the algorithm.</b><br>
            Many users dream of verifying their Instagram profile and getting a blue checkmark next to their 
            nickname. The verified badge looks cool and confirms that you are a known person, but it does not 
            provide an advantage over the algorithms.<br>
            The blue checkmark does not affect the reach of the account, ranking in the top, recommendations, 
            search results and does not ensure the first priority to receive new features, updates and 
            priority responses from the support service. The privileges of the verified accounts are another 
            myth. Instagram confirmed this on their blog.<br>
            At the bottom, verification is a way for people to know which accounts are genuine and visible. 
            Passing verification does not mean that Instagram algorithms approve your content in terms of 
            where it appears.<br>
            In other words, account verification is definitely cool. It increases other people's trust in the 
            profile. If you think your account is of public interest, apply, you may be the one to get the 
            blue checkmark. But don't expect Instagram algorithms to evaluate your content differently after 
            that.<br>


            <b>4. Correspondence in Direct matters</b><br>
            Few people take into account such an important indicator for the algorithm as correspondence in 
            Direct. But it is also important when it comes to feed rankings.<br>
            The number of dialogues, the frequency of communication - all this activity is considered by 
            Instagram algorithms. For a big reach, you need to communicate with the audience more often.<br>
            Here's what you can do today to increase your reach in your account:<br>
            ● Do not ignore messages;<br>
            ● Write to followers who have not been active for a long time;<br>
            ● Ask to leave detailed answers on stories;<br>
            ● Ask questions in response to develop a dialogue.<br>
            Communication with the audience is important not only for the algorithm, but also for creating a 
            cohesive community, a key Instagram trend in 2022. The events that are taking place in the world 
            have forced many people to remain in isolation. People lack communication, they are looking for 
            accounts in which they can not only listen, but also be heard. Maintain a dialogue with the 
            audience, and then your content will not go unnoticed.<br>

            <b>5. New followers see your content more often in the feed</b><br>
            Have you noticed that as soon as you follow someone, he begins to flicker very often in the feed? 
            Instagram is really trying to show the users their new subscriptions more often. And this is one 
            of the reasons of dropped reaches. Those who have subscribed to you for a very long time see you 
            less often. Especially if after that they actively subscribed to other users.<br>

            Conclusion: "old" followers need to be reanimated. All you need to do is to set a targeting on 
            your audience.<br>
            If it is not possible to launch targeting, you can reanimate the audience manually. Open posts 
            published 3-5 months ago. Go to the pages of the most active commentators from these posts, like 
            them, leave a couple of comments. You can even write them a message in Direct, ask how they are 
            doing, but this is not necessary.<br>
            As practice shows, 3-5 likes will be enough for most followers to recall you, go to the page and 
            like posts in response. The algorithm will remember this interaction and start showing you in the 
            feed of these followers again.<br>


            <b>6. It's inefficient to publish too much content in one day</b><br>
            After another drop in reach, many users began to publish twice as much content to appear more 
            often in the feed. But as it turned out, this strategy is ineffective. Instagram makes sure that 
            the feed is diverse and does not contain many messages from the same person.<br>
            By publishing more than one post per day, you:<br>
            Will get less impressions. Grabbing different topics and asking too many questions can exhaust followers. Give them time to talk about one topic, digest it, and then publish a new post.<br>
            Can annoy subscribers. Content loses value if it becomes too much of it. And if frequent posting affects the quality of content, unfollows can happen as well.<br>
            Compete with yourself. By publishing multiple posts in a short period of time, you make them compete with each other. Instagram will evaluate which post gets the most impressions and which doesn't, and the second one will get less views.<br>
            On average, brands, bloggers and experts publish 3-4 posts a week.<br>


            <b>7. The feed of posts and stories have the same algorithms</b><br>
            The ranking rules for the stories feed and publications are absolutely the same. At the same time, 
            the stories affects the feed. If users frequently interact with your stories, send reactions to 
            them, touch stickers, take part in a survey, you will appear in their feed more often.<br>
            The feed and stories are relatively simple; these are all the latest posts shared by the people 
            you follow. In the feed, the five interactions we look at most closely are the likelihood that 
            you will take the time to post, comment on it, like it, save it, and click on the profile photo. 
            The more likely you are to take an action, and the more we will weigh that action, the bigger 
            chance that you will see the message.<br>


            <b>8. Instagram really hides some of the content</b><br>
            Rumors around the shadow ban have been around for a very long time. Instagram, on the one hand, 
            does not confirm that it exists, but does not deny it either.<br>
            So, for example, it is known that social network restricts the display of content from the account in which the following is published:<br>
            ● Content that promotes and demonstrates eating disorder, suicide, self-mutilation;<br>
            ● Content that contains violence;<br>
            ● Content of a sexual nature;<br>
            ● Smoking cigarettes, hookah and vaping;<br>
            ● Services and goods for adults;<br>
            ● Someone else's content;<br>
            ● Threats and hostile speech;<br>
            ● Fully or partially naked children.<br>
            Such content is almost never included in recommendations and it is difficult to get additional reach with it. But followers can still see it.<br>
            Remember that violating the Instagram guidelines can lead to account blocking. Bookmark the instructions on how to unblock your account so as not to get confused and fall for the tricks of scammers in this situation. In 90% of cases, a blocked account can be restored within 2-4 weeks

          <h4 class="modal__right-title">What are CRM systems required for?</h4>
          <p class="modal__right-descr">
            It is very important to find the right approach to customers in today's competitive environment. 
            But it is quite difficult to please everyone in a large information flow. This is what the modern 
            CRM systems were created for.<br> 

            <b>What are CRM systems?</b><br> 
            CRM is a Customer Relationship Management. It is a business management program that helps you 
            increase profits, reduce costs and speed up the processing of applications.<br> 
            A CRM system is needed to build a competent dialogue with the customer: it allows you to avoid 
            mistakes and, as a result, the customer can order more products.<br> 
            CRM includes the software for: <br> 
            ● collecting customer data;<br> 
            ● deal management;<br> 
            ● control over managers;<br> 
            ● analytics and forecasting.<br> 
            Basically, CRM is an Excel spreadsheet with a gigantic customer base. You can listen to call 
            records, view the purchase history, launch e-mail campaign or sms distribution, set tasks for 
            employees.<br> 
            When a customer calls, the system offers to open his card, where you can see the customer’s full 
            name and all his previous orders. Then the system will remind him about the meeting or the status 
            of the order itself.<br> 
            Now there are many CRM systems on the market that differ in their set of functions, the 
            possibility of integration with other services and the flexibility of settings.<br> 
            The main features of the CRM system are as follows:<br> 
            ● Recording the history of relationships with all current and potential customers of the company.<br> 
            ● Scheduling and setting tasks for the day.<br> 
            ● Automatically generated online reports.<br> 
            ● Integration with mail, social networks, SMS and Email, telephony.<br> 
            ● Funds management.<br> 
            ● Service cost counter.<br> 
            ● Business process automation.<br> 
            Thus, CRM performs operational routine tasks: creates documents and online reports, generates necessary tasks, sends emails to customers, calculates the cost of services using the built-in calculator, reminds you of important dates and automatically performs the necessary actions (for example, issue an invoice for payment or extend agreement).<br> 
            CRM, in simple words, allows you to work not from memory, but using a systematic approach, where all processes are configured automatically.<br> 

            Ultimately, CRM helps to improve the quality of customer service, increase sales and improve the reputation in the market as a whole. CRM also saves the manager's time, as he spends significantly less time on controlling the employees and overall sales plan.
            There are many CRM systems on the market today: Bitrix24, amoCRM, WireCRM, retailCRM, EnvyCRM, SalesForce and others.<br> 
            When choosing a CRM system, you need to consider your objectives, the number of employees and plans for further business scaling.

          <h4 class="modal__right-title">How to choose a CMS for a website?</h4>
          <p class="modal__right-descr">
            Many managers, applying for the development of the website, require that the resource be designed 
            on a specific CMS, while the main selection criterion for many of them is the popularity or price 
            of the CMS. As a rule, many people have very blurry ideas about its convenience and functionality.<br>

            CMS (also known as “engine”) is a website content management system. It is the backbone everything 
            is built on. The convenience of filling the site, its "friendliness" for search engine promotion 
            and the ability to connect additional services depend on the engine.<br>

            Universe of “engines”: variety of types. All existing CMS can be conditionally divided into 3 
            large categories:<br>

            ● Self-hosted;<br>
            ● Boxed;<br>
            ● Constructors.<br>

            Each category has pros and cons, and each can be tailored more or less effectively. The main point 
            is to decide on the tasks that your website should solve.<br>

            <b>1. Self-hosted CMS</b><br>
            A self-hosted CMS is a content management system that is designed from scratch for the tasks of 
            a particular business. This is a non-serial solution. It is created for a single project and is 
            not replicated.<br>
            
            <b>Full compliance with your business objectives</b><br>

            Boxed engines and constructors have a set of modules to expand the functionality of the site, 
            but ready-made solutions always have limitations, and you will have to make compromises.
            A custom control system will fully meet the tasks specified in the List of Requirements, 
            because it is not developed to be sold to a motley audience later. The developer keeps only your 
            requirements in mind.<br>

            <b>Integration of the latest achievements</b><br>
            Technology is constantly outpacing the market. Even if you buy the latest version of a boxed CMS, you cannot be sure that all the achievements available at the moment were incorporated in it. By creating an engine for you, the developer has access to the latest programming technologies and, if you are lucky, will apply them while working on your project.<br>

            <b>Exclusivity</b><br>
            You can boast that you are the owner of an exclusive solution, unique functionality, breakthrough development. Be sure you get the honor and respect from colleagues, indignation and envy from the competitors (and, most likely, bewilderment of the well-informed people.<br>

            <b>Unproven technology</b><br>
            Serial solutions are being worked out on thousands of websites (for example, more than 2000 projects have already been created on Canape CMS). Bugs found in previous versions are fixed in each next build. This means you don't have to suffer your own bumps and bruises.<br>
            If your website is built on a self-hosted (i.e. non-serial) CMS, you will be a pioneer. Tuning processes, adjusting algorithms and programming the necessary modules from scratch will fall on the shoulders of your developer. And he will have to deal with mistakes on his own<br>
            
            <b>No technical support</b><br>
            All problems will have to be solved on their own. And, most likely, nobody will help on forums.<br>

            <b>Difficulties in SEO promotion</b><br>
            Usually in such systems, if there is any kind of SEO functionality, then it is presented rather poorly, because programmers and SEO specialists are the creatures from the different worlds. Much will have to be tweaked during the process.<br>

            <b>Full dependence on the developer</b><br>
            When agreeing to a self-hosted engine, get yourself prepared to be with the developer for centuries, for better for worse until you are parted by death with no further amendments to the text... We strongly do not recommend quarreling, since the viability of a self-hosted website depends on the author of the code.<br>
            Usually there is no regulated technical documentation for such engines, and if you suddenly decide to change the development team, there is a high probability that the site will have to be redone on a different engine. Digging into someone else's code is dubious and can cost a lot.<br>

            <b>2. Boxed CMS</b><br>
            Boxed CMS is a ready-made software product. Such a system can be downloaded (in the case of free solutions) or bought (commercial engines). It would be incorrect to compare free and commercial products, as they have fundamental differences that are important for business.
            Free engines out of the box<br>
            Examples: WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Opencart, Magento and so on.<br>

            <b>Open relationships with the developer</b><br>
            Thanks to the freeware, many people know about such products. So, it will not be difficult for you to find a developer. And it will not be a problem to replace him if your ways depart.<br>

            <b>Cheap (if compromises are made)</b><br>
            Developing websites on such engines is relatively inexpensive. Basic functionality is usually free. You can find a huge number of plug-ins for a variety of tasks, and many of them are also free.<br>

            <b>Changing design in 2 clicks</b><br>
            In boxed engines, it is possible to add design templates - if you are tired of the design, you can download / buy a new one and install on the website. Sometimes this is done in 2 clicks<br>

            <b>Lack of a single standard</b><br>
            Open-source solutions do not have a single development standard, so even despite the huge army of WordPress developers, every next specialist will want to remake your CMS for themselves<br>

            <b>Module selection problem</b><br>
            A large selection of modules can also become a problem. Since completely different people can create them, a huge number of solutions for the same tasks are proliferating on the network. It can be difficult to determine which module is suitable for a particular task. When connecting, it is better to cross your fingers, it may not be compatible with your version of the engine<br>

            <b>Viruses</b><br>
            Sometimes free modules are created solely for the purpose of spreading viruses. That is, the plugin seems to be useful, but in fact it is a loophole for infection. Many free templates for WordPress and Joomla have this sin, template developers use them to post links and even viruses to make money.br>

            <b>Vulnerability</b><br>
            Vulnerability is the price you have to pay when choosing a free open coded engine. Due to (or because of) the popularity of such solutions, these websites are hacked much more often. Although there are no viruses in the source code, it costs nothing for attackers to hack the site and infect it. You must develop countless patches to bypass the problem.<br>

            <b>No technical support</b><br>
            But there is a large community of developers, and the forums will most likely help you. But there is no tech support. That is, it may take a very long time to find a solution, and the effect is not guaranteed.<br>

            <b>SEO restrictions</b><br>
            It is difficult to promote such websites. Either it is not possible to edit meta tags (you need to connect a plugin in WordPress), or rel=”canonical” cannot be written on some templates.<br>
            Joomla, for example, is known for a messy code. It creates several duplicates for each page of the website, so it will be extremely difficult for you to break to the top searches. That is why  websites on Joomla are poorly indexed. And loaded slowly for the same reason.<br>
            Drupal also generates a lot of extra stuff. If you finally figure out what modules you need for SEO, then get ready to puzzle over how to get rid of the extra technical pages that the system will spawn.<br>

            <b>Difficult to edit content</b><br>
            In many free CMS, to make minimal improvements to the display of one page, sometimes you cannot avoid the help of a developer, which is not free.<br>

            <b>Commercial boxed CMS</b><br>
            Examples: 1C-Bitrix, NetCat, HostCMS, UMI.CMS, CS-Cart, etc.<br>
            Easy to select and change developers<br>
            You can easily find a developer to work with popular paid solutions (as well as popular free ones).<br>

            <b>Specialization</b><br>
            Many commercial serial engines are tailored to solve specific task groups. For example, there are CMSs that are convenient for building online stores (Amiro CMS, CS-Cart).<br>

            <b>Serious technical support</b><br>
            You will not be left in trouble if you have questions about the integration of services, problems with connecting modules or software bugs.<br>

            <b>Annual royalties</b><br>
            You will have to renew your license. Without buying a license for the next year, you will not be able to update the CMS to the latest version and it will be much more difficult to fulfill the requirements of search engines, for example.<br>

            <b>The need for tweaks</b><br>
            If you change the developer, you will still have to tweak it<br>

            <b>Content Editor Unfriendliness</b><br>
            Usually in such CMS there are problems with content, it is difficult to figure it out without a developer. Content managers scare children with stories about sites on 1C-Bitrix.<br>

            <b>Paid technical support</b><br>
            They will be helping you, but not for free.<br>
            
            <b>3. Website builders</b><br>
            The constructor is an online platform for creating websites. To build a simple site on the constructor, you don't need to mess around with code, databases, or hosting. No download or installation is required. You register on the platform, specify the necessary settings, select a template - the site is ready. This is a cheap and often beautiful solution for one-pagers and simple websites.<br>
            Examples: Tilda, Nethouse, Wix, uKit, Weebly, etc.<br>

            <b>Fast (and on my own)</b><br>
            The constructor allows you to quickly (and on your own) concoct a landing page or a simple website.
            Most of the time no special knowledge is required. You can create a website to run ads on it in a day.<br>

            <b>Popular</b><br>
            If you don’t want to do it yourself or you need to “tweak” something, you can easily find a developer for the website that is based on a popular constructor.
            True, improvements are possible only in terms of frontend and content. Don't even think about functional modifications.<br>

            <b>Cheap</b><br>
            You can cheaply build a beautiful one-pager or a simple website that can collect requests on Wix or Tilda.<br>

            <b>Forget complex functionality</b><br>
            If complex software improvements are required, compromises will have to be made. For example, using Tilda's tools, it will not be possible to ensure that the responses about orders come to additional mail. The technical support service will answer that there is no such functionality, but it will possibly be added in the future. Or it won't.<br>

            <b>Captured by someone else's hosting</b><br>
            By choosing a SaaS solution to create a website, you become dependent on someone else's hosting. The possibility of transferring to another hosting only exists in rare constructors, and if there is, it costs a lot.<br>
            In addition, if the pricing policy of the designer suddenly becomes not so close to you (the monthly fee, say, will grow 4 times), you will have to remake the website in another place, either on a different constructor, or already on a CMS.<br>

            <b>No responsibility</b><br>
            In addition, usually the offer agreement with the owners of the constructors is drawn up in such a way that the company does not bear any responsibility before you:<br>
            •	for hosting downtime,<br>
            •	for system failures,<br>
            •	for non-compliance with the law,<br>
            •	for "sudden" updates,<br>
            •	for blocking.<br>
            These are all your risks, reputational and financial.<br>
