              Chatbot in WhatsApp for a network of beauty salons, allowing to automate the flow of clients from the site and direct to the address of the salon, which is located closest. 
              Clients, in turn, get the contacts of the salon of interest and can, if necessary, switch to a chat with the administrator of the salon. 
              The administrators can read the entire correspondence and answer the client on behalf of the bot or by personal phone number.

              numbers and increased the loyalty of regular visitors.

              campaigns to attract locals and international guests, targeting audiences to increase bookings on

              the catering staff and guests of the restaurant increased the number of regular visitors.

              New World real estate agency in Dubai has formed a goal to attract clients to buy real estate (apartments) for investment, profit (from 10% ready) and diversification of funds through advertising on Instagram and Facebook.
              We tested more than 30 advertising creatives, identified the 6 most profitable bundles with which we conducted a / b tests, and then scaled them.
              A month after the start of the work we collected the retargeting base, launched ads and got cheaper leads than from cold ads, we were also able to catch up the audience that left.
              It was found through experience that simple photos with minimal text on the picture worked best.

              The CRM has reduced the number of unprocessed requests from potential clients, developed and 
              automated the system of touching regular clients (text messages, appointment reminders, etc.). 
              The CRM system displays all calls and applications from the website or social networks, allowing 
              you to calculate an indicator such as LTV (total revenue the company receives from one client for 
              the entire period of cooperation with him). This has increased the transparency of all staff and 
              ensured a high customer return.
